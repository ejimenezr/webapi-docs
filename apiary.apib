--- WebAPI Documentation ---
---
The WebAPI is a collection of RESTful web services for interacting with TradeStation. These services accept and/or return object data bia standard HTTP requests.

All requests are made via HTTPS URIs that represent objects as a hierarchy of resources and/or actions. The data object format is either JSON or XML and is determined by the request's accept header. Security is based on the OAuth 2.0 spec and all requests require a user access token be included.

We are currently on Version 2 of the WebAPI - baseurl = [https://api.tradestation.com/v2](https://api.tradestation.com/v2)

Here is a simple example of requesting a list of accounts for a particular user:

```
--REQUEST--
GET https://api.tradestation.com/WebAPI/users/testuser/accounts HTTP/1.1
Authorization: QUNCSmI
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Security Overview

Tradestation WebAPI authorization is based on the OAuth 2.0 specification

All WebAPI clients require an Access Token in order to access protected resources. The application flow for obtaining a token will vary from application to application but all tokens are issued via the `/security/authorize` service which grants tokens based on "Grant Types". Currently, WebAPI supports OAuth 2.0's Authorization Code, Client Credentials, and Password grant types.

The WebAPI issues Access Tokens of type Bearer.

```
Bearer Token
    A security token with the property that any party in possession of
    the token (a "bearer") can use the token in any way that any other
    party in possession of it can. Using a bearer token does not
    require a bearer to prove possession of crptographic key material
    (proof-of-possession).
```

Notes:

* Users authorizing an API client must have their Multi-Factor questions and answers defined, otherwise Authorization will fail.
* The Password grant type is disabled since it requires the end-user to provide login credentials to the API Client directly.
* All requests require HTTPS. Some examples may be from a test environment and use HTTP for demonstration only.
